## The approach to testing

As previously mentioned, this is a small throw-away home project.  
Given it's simplicity, I did not write any tests.  
Should you find a test in here, it was written initially to debug something, and has since found a new home here.  

Given their accidental nature, they follow no particular rigour just as the ZOMBIES testing ideology.

## Running tests

cd to project directory
`python3 -m pytest .`
